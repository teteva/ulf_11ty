[<cite>FaceType Foundry</cite>](https://www.facetype.org) has a very simple yet beautiful start page that gives an excellent overview of their creative typefaces of which many are probably best suited for display type. Nearly every type looks interesting to me. To pick some:

- [Darjeeling](https://www.facetype.org/?font=darjeeling) with indian ornaments
- [Blitzplakat](https://www.facetype.org/?font=blitzplakat-2)
- [Flint](https://www.facetype.org/?font=flint)
- [Ivory](https://www.facetype.org/?font=ivory)
- [Letterpress](https://www.facetype.org/?font=letterpress)
- [Newcastle](https://www.facetype.org/?font=newcastle)
- [Pinback](https://www.facetype.org/?font=pinback)
