Jeremy Keith published a transcript and the slides of his talk about *Web3, AI and Design*. The AI-part is helping me a lot to get a better understanding about the topic. 

> Use these tools for inputs, not outputs. I would never publish the output of one of these tools publicly. But I might use one of these tools at the beginning of the process to get over the blank page. If I want to get a bunch of mediocre ideas out of the way quickly, these tools can help.

Here is my compressed list of Jeremy´s statements:

- **GPT**: AI today means typically large language models and machine learning. A big amount of data is taken and numeric tokens are assigned to the data. A token represents a bigger item, like a phrase in a piece of text. The GPT part of ChatGPT stands for **Generative Pre-trained Transformer**. The pre-training are the big data tokens. <q>The generative part is about combining—or transforming—tokens in a way that should make **probabalistic** sense.</q> It is about applied statistics, because it works on implied correlations.
- **Overfitting**: The output of a GPT is too close to the original data (plagiarism).
-  **Hallucinations**: The output of a GPT strays to far from reality. <q>Another word for this is lying. Although the truth is that all of the output is a form of hallucination—that’s the generative part.</q>
-  **Autocomplete**: AI can be seen as a kind of advanced autocomplete. Large language models do this on a big scale.
-  **Transformation**: LLM are good at transforming. Text to speech, spech to text, text to images, long form to short form, short form to long form. Even coding can be seen as a kind of transformation.
-  **How to use**: The AI tools will not help with understanding and defining the problem to solve. The tools are good at quantity, not quality. Use them for input during your design process, **not for output**. You can get a bunch of mediocre ideas quickly.
