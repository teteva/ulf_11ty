[<cite>Design Takes Time</cite>](https://ia.net/topics/design-takes-time) is another piece of iA´s background information about their new product, iA Presenter. This time it´s about the evolution of the iA Presenter icon, which i found very interesting to read. I appreciate iA´s openness and their decision to run a beta programme for Presenter to get feedback.
