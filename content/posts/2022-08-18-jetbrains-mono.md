JetBrains Mono is my coding font and it has been for years. It´s easy enough to configure VSCode to use the font. What I noticed when switching to a different machine, where this font is not installed, I´m immediately missing the super nice ligatures, which are <q>to reduce noise by merging symbols and removing details so the eyes are processing less.</q> The font is free of charge, for both commercial and non-commercial purposes. You can download it at the beautiful [JetBrains Mono Homepage](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/). Take the time to stray around and explore the features and the comparisons with other fonts. There is a [JetBrains Mono GitHub Repo](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono) which explains more ways to install.
