title: JavaScript Design Patterns
tags: code

The [JavaScript Design Patterns](https://www.patterns.dev/posts#design-patterns) are an excellent resource to improve your webapp architecture. They are a part of <cite>Patterns.dev</cite>, by Lydia Hallie and Addy Osmani. You can [download the book](https://www.patterns.dev/book) in various formats for free, or read it online. While the JavaScript design patterns are vanilla JavaScript, other parts of the book refer to React patterns.

> [Patterns â€¦] can guide you when facing a problem other developers have encountered many times before, but are not a blunt tool for jamming into every scenario. <cite>Patterns.dev</cite> aims to be a catalog of patterns (for increasing awareness) rather than a checklist (what you must do).
