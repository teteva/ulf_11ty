> Site generators focused on performance, shipping low to zero-client-JavaScript (e.g. the one I work on, Eleventy) typically use full page navigations. SPA advocates have rebranded this architecture as a Multi-Page Application (MPA) but fundamentally this is how the web has always operated.

ZachÂ´s article is another piece in a series of recent writings by different people who are pointing out the benefits of Multi Page Applications (*how the web always operated* :-)). Zach makes some bullet points (I changed the order of topics to reflect the importance they have to me):

- Better accessibility defaults
- Inclusive and robust by default
- Privacy-focused
- Searchable by default
- Better empty cache performance
- Energy-efficiency

Read to the end to get links to similar articles by Manuel Matuzovic, Jason Godesky ([<cite>When JavaScript Fails</cite>](https://scribe.rip/@jason.godesky/when-javascript-fails-52eef47e90db), great!), and several articles by Jake Archibald (among is a [tweet](https://twitter.com/jaffathecake/status/1433317536754458628) showing GitHub opening faster when used as a Multi Page App in a new tab compared to following their Single Page App link).
