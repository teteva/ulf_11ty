This is brilliant. [<cite>Cooklang</cite>](https://cooklang.org), a language for personal cooking recipe management. 

<blockquote>
Hereâ€™s how the Cooklang ecosystem makes that happen:
<ul>
<li>All recipes are human-readable text files.</li>
<li>Everything is a file. No databases. And you have complete control over your information.</li>
<li>All the tools are simple, focused, and efficient; the UNIX way.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

I wonder if it would be possible to have parts of that functionality within a markdown-it plugin? It could be used also for other things, like technical descriptions with part reference lists.
