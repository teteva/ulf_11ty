tags: code

A list of lists:

- Luke Hoban (+27 contributors) compiled a comprehensive list of the [features new with ES6](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features) on GitHub.
- Another list, which puts ES6 and ES5 syntax aside of each other, is [es6-features.org](http://es6-features.org/). That list was originated by Ralf Engelschall (+ 20 contributors).
- And there is [jsfeatures.in](https://jsfeatures.in), which has ES5, ES6, and ES7 features with a search function.
