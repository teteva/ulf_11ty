[<cite>4 design principles I use every day to avoid bad UX and create products that work for everyone</cite>](https://adamsilver.io/blog/4-design-principles-i-use-every-day-to-avoid-bad-ux-and-create-products-that-work-for-everyone/) by Adam Silver. I like them very much.  Adam´s examples not only bring you a step further in understanding the principles, but maybe give you the next action item to improve your current design work.

1. **Good design works for everyone** *Examples:* Plain language isn’t just easier to read for people with low literacy; experts find it easier to read too. Large radio buttons don’t just help people with motor impairments; everyone finds them easier to click.
2. **Good design makes things obvious** *Examples:* Instead of using a hamburger menu, just show the navigation items and let them wrap if necessary. Instead of hiding hint text in tooltips, just show the hint inline.
3. **Good design puts users in control** *Examples:* Instead of expecting users to fill out a form in one go, expect them to get interrupted and let them save and finish later. Instead of showing a menu on hover, show it on click.
4. **Good design is lightweight** *Examples:* Kill the background video and prioritise the content and flow. Kill those tooltips and reduce the content to its irreducible core.
