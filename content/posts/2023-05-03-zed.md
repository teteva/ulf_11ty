The [<cite>Zed editor</cite>](https://zed.dev/) is in beta. It is built by the small team formerly working on Atom and Electron. The editor allows collaborative multi-cursor editing and even screensharing. Other than Electron, it feels very fast overall. Check their impressive [feature list](https://zed.dev/features). I like the minimal user interface, which seems to be inline with the teams vision:

> So we constantly ask ourselves how we can maximize signal and minimize noise. Our goal is to find the most efficient way to accomplish each coding task and make it accessible. Joyful coding starts with an editor that stays out of your way.
