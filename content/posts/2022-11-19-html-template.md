title: HTML template tag
tags: code

I didn´t know the `<template>` tag existed. It´s for <q>significant HTML structures that need to be injected at runtime</q> and Kitty Giraudel points out why it makes sense to use it: [<cite>Templating in HTML</cite>](https://kittygiraudel.com/2022/09/30/templating-in-html/).
