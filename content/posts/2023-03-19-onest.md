[<cite>Onest</cite>](https://onest.md/en/)^[[<cite>Onest</cite>](https://onest.md/en/), free font] is a free font by Andrey Kudryavtsev. The stated goal of this font is:

> This is the first Moldovan made typeface created with a mere goal — to make communication between the state and the citizen honest and understandable.

> Onest is suitable for reading long texts from the screens of any device and is recommended for government and social service sites.

Onest is friendly, squarish, has many symbols, broad eastern language support, and works equally well for display and body text. It has options for stylistic alternates that make it legible for screen reading. Again, I got aware via Oliver Schöndorfer´s Font Friday.
