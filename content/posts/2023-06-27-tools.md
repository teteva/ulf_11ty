I appreaciate the line of thought. E.g., currently I have to observe multiple Teams channels to stay informed about what´s going on in a geographically distributed team. In addition there is email (not used too often), Confluence, and Azure DevOps. Even with the distracting push notifications of Teams it´s  easy to miss something important. I find that to be more problematic than helpful. On the other hand, tools are important. Tools are part of a software developers craft and you cannot write software without them. I believe the more serious you are about the software you write and the process you follow, the more serious you are about the tools to apply. It becomes very personal. I like to see similarities to the tool usage of the Kigumi house builder.
