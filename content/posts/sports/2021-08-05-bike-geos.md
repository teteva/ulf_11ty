Geometries of bikes I find interesting. For comparison my reference is the <span class="bg-primary-5">Rose XEON TEAM GF 57 road marathon bike</span>, which I´m riding for multiple years now. ^[When you don´t find the geometry data for older bikes on the manufacturers page, bike geometries can be looked up at [geometrygeeks.bike](https://geometrygeeks.bike)]

<tr><td>Fairlight Strael 3.0 (tall)</td><td>James Hayden, the two-times winner of the Transcontinental, rode a Strael. It´s a steel bike weighing under 9 kilo´s. Fairlight offers the regular and tall geometries, which I think is an incredible commitment to rider needs. Their design notes, written by Dom Thomas who is the bike designer of Fairlight cycles, really talk to me.</td><td>56</td><td>600</td><td>380</td><td>73.5</td><td>73</td><td>57</td><td>418</td><td>1002</td><td>68</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
