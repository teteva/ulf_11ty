## Wheels

14 April 2022

1. **Tubes and tires:** Because I do not run tubeless, I have to remove the tubeless valves first. From that point on I´m following [<cite>How to change an innertube</cite>](/2022-02-06-how-to-change-an-inner-tube/). Shimano recommends not to use tire leavers with the C36s, and fortunately, the GP5000s didn´t require it. 
3. **Brake rotors:** Once the rim is protected by the inflated tire it´s save to mount the brake rotors and torque them with 40 NM. I do not use anti-seize nor grease for the direct mount connection and the lockring threads of the rotors. The parts are all aluminium and the given torque spec is for dry torque (without grease or anything similar). Putting anti-seize or grease on the thread would increase tension on the thread when torquing it to 40 NM. Also, I avoid using grease near the brakes.
4. **Cassette:** Be careful when mounting the cassette. It will fall apart all too easily and you might have difficulties putting everything back in the right order. I put a thin film of anti-seize on the freehub body to help demounting the cassette later on. It could well be that´s not necessary because the sprockets are on an aluminium spider and the freehub body is also alumunium. Again, no anti-seize on the lockring thread which will be torqued down to 40 NM.
