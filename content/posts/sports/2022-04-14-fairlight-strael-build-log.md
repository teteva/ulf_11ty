## Wheels

### Tools
- #Wera Click-Torque X 3{}

### Steps

1. **Tubes and tires:** Because I do not run tubeless, I have to remove the tubeless valves first. From that point on I´m following [<cite>How to change an innertube</cite>](/2022-02-06-how-to-change-an-inner-tube/). Shimano recommends not to use tire leavers with the C36s, and fortunately, the GP5000s didn´t require it. Tires are inflated to 60 PSI.
3. **Brake rotors:** Once the rim is protected by the inflated tire it´s save to mount the brake rotors and torque them with 40 NM. I do not use anti-seize nor grease for the direct mount connection and the lockring threads of the rotors. The parts are all aluminium and the given torque spec is for dry torque (without grease or anything similar). Putting anti-seize or grease on the thread would increase tension on the thread when torquing it to 40 NM. Also, I avoid using grease near the brakes.
4. **Cassette:** Be careful when mounting the cassette. It will fall apart all too easily and you might have difficulties putting everything back in the right order. I put a thin film of anti-seize on the freehub body to help demounting the cassette later on. It could well be that´s not necessary because the sprockets are on an aluminium spider and the freehub body is also alumunium. Again, no anti-seize on the lockring thread which will be torqued down to 40 NM.

## Di2 Wiring

### Tools

- #My very high end do-it-yourself routing tool – a short and bent steel wire{}.
  <figure>
  <img src="/img/sports/high-end-routing-tool.jpg" alt="A hand holding a bent steel wire">
  <figcaption>My high end Di2 wire routing tool</figcaption>
  </figure>
- #Folding Meter{}
- #Di2 Plug Tool for EW-SD300 wires (TL-EW300){}
- #5 mm Hex Key{}
- #Park Tool Repair Stand PCS-10.3{}. I´m happy with that. It is sturdy, has a secure and stable stand, can be adjusted in height, and the clamp mechanism works pretty well.
- #Park Tool Handlebar Holder HBH-2{}
- #Tesa Crepe{}


### Steps

I use the following process for the wiring: Pushing the Di2 wire through a tube into the desired direction. When the Di2 wire plug becomes visible at the target opening I use my do-it-yourself routing tool to fish the Di2 wire out of the target opening and pull the Di2 wire by hand  further. It´s not necessary to have anything more.

1. **Battery:** The wiring starts by inserting the Di2 battery into the seatpost. The Ritchey Battery Mount surrounds the battery nicely and fits well into the Ritchey seat post. 

   <figcaption>The battery has to be pushed into the seat post (further than you see on this image)</figcaption>
   </figure>      
2. **Seat tube wire:** I push a 700 mm Di2 wire into the seat tube from the top opening towards the bottom bracket shell. The wire has three wire holders attached to prevent it from moving inside the seat tube. I use a folding ruler to push the wire towards the bottom bracket shell. 
3. **Mounting the seat post:** The seat post wire can now be connected to the battery by using the Shimano Plug Tool. As a next step the seat post can be mounted to the frame. Now the frame is ready to be taken into the repair stand by clamping the seat post with the 5 mm Hex Key. The Di2 wire plug has not been pulled out of the seat tube. With the frame inside the repair stand this is left to be done and I use my routing tool to fish the plug and pull it further trhough the bottom bracket shell.

   <figcaption>Pulling the Di2 plug out of the seat tube into the bottom bracket shell</figcaption>
   </figure>
4. **Rear derailleur wire:** That didn´t went ideal. At first I pushed a 650 mm Di2 wire without any routing tool and with three wire holders attached from the rear lug through the chain stay towards the bottom bracket shell. At some point I couldn´t make any progress and because of the wire holders it was pretty difficult to pull the wire back out of the chain stay. I needed to apply so much force that I´m in doubt about the wire integrity. My second attempt was to remove the wire holders except of one, and push the wire, starting at the bottom bracket shell, through the chain stay to the lug at the end of the chain stay. When the wire plug became visible through the lug it was again time for my DIY routing tool to fish the Di2 wire through the lug. 
   <figure>

   <figcaption>Fishing the Di2 wire with my routing tool</figcaption>
   </figure>
   That second attempt went smoothly. The one wire holder that was attached to the Di2 wire was near the bottom bracket shell. By pulling the Di2 wire further through the chain stay in direction of the dropous, the wire holder slipped into the chain stay. Then I added another wire holder near the dropouts and pulled the Di2 wire back a little bit into the direction of the bottom bracket shell. As a result I have two wire holders attached to the Di2 wire. Because of my concerns about the Di2 wire integrity I repeated the process with a 700 mm wire (that is a leftover wire, 700 mm are not necessary, 650 mm length should be fine). 
5. **Down tube wire:** After removing the Fairlight cable guide from the down tube the lug appears to push the 1200 mm Di2 wire through. I remove all wire holders and route the wire through the down tube towards the bottom bracket shell. With my routing tool, again, I can fish the plug out of the tube opening inside of the bottom bracket shell and pull the wire further so that finally 60 cm of wire hang out of the bottom bracket shell. Now I can attach four wire holders and pull the wire back into the down tube. Very smooth.
6. **Handlebar wire:** It´s easy to push the 700 mm Di2 wire through the handlebars and fish the wire plug with my routing tool out of the lug. I´ve 4 wire holders attached.

   </figure>
7. **Front derailleur wire:** This is a 300 mm Di2 wire. I insert it through the lug in the down tube with a single wire holder attached. Again I use my DIY routing tool to get the wire out of the down tube into the bottom bracket shell.
8. **Junction:** All the wires ending in the bottom bracket shell are getting connected with the EW-JC304 junction.

- #6 mm Hex Key{}

### Steps

Before cutting the steerer tube I assemble the fork into the frame and put as many spacers onto the steerer tube as I assume will be needed. I have the geometry of the new frame and can compare it to the geo of my old frame. Theoretically I can calculate the number of required spacers but cutting off something from my shiny new fork scares me in a way that I want to try things first. That in addition requires mounting the handlebars, the shifters, the wheels and the saddle.

1. **Fork:** The headset top cap comes with two shims. I found to get a tight outer seal for the rubber of the headset top cap one spacer was enough in my case. The Hope headset has three convincing seals (two top, one bottom).
   <div class="split md:bleed">

   <figure>
   <img src="/img/sports/one-headset-spacer.jpg">
   <figcaption>Removing one of the shims to get a tight seal</figcaption>
   </figure>
   </div>
   After putting the fork into the head tube, I´m mounting the headset and putting 3 x 1 cm spacers onto the steerer to lift the stem. I do not apply any grease at this point in time because everything will be disassembled again to cut the steerer tube. The stem is not fully tightened for now.
   <figure>
   <img src="/img/sports/stem-spacers.jpg">
   <figcaption>Lifting the stem by 3 cm</figcaption>
   </figure>
2. **Handlebars with shifters:** I adjust the shifters like you see in the image. This way the brake lever has just the right distance to the drop bar hand position and the shifter hoods prolongue a straight top line for the upper handle bar.
   <figure>
   <img src="/img/sports/shifter-top-position.jpg">
   <figcaption>Finding a shifter position</figcaption>
   </figure>
   I adjust the side rotation of the shifters by aligning a water level with the side of the handlebars and making shure the shifter level touches the edge of the water level ever so slightly.
   <figure>
   <img src="/img/sports/shifter-side-rotation.jpg">
   <figcaption>Adjusting the side rotation of the shifers</figcaption>
   </figure>
   Once the shifters are in tune, I´m mounting the handlebars to the stem, center the handlebars, and tighten the stem to the steerer a little bit more, but not to the final torque.
3. **Wheels:** The thru axles of the Strael require a 6 mm Hex key for mounting the wheels.
4. **Saddle:** The saddle is mounted with a 5 mm Hex Key and put to the correct height, measuring from the center of the bottom bracket shell to the main sitting area. I´ve read that the Ritchey Link seat post makes it difficult to tune in the right saddle position but I found it quite the opposite. It´s a clear, simple, and straightforward interface and I couldn´t ask for more.

## Cutting the steerer tube

### Tools

- Tesa Crepe
- #Hacksaw with Park Tool Carbon Cutting Saw Blade CSB-1. You do not need the Park Tool saw itself if you already have a hacksaw that can hold the 300 mm saw blade.{}
- #Topeak Threadless Saw Guide{}
- #Sanding Block with P120 Sanding Paper{}

### Steps

I´m following [<cite>How To Cut A Road Bike Steerer Tube</cite>](https://www.globalcyclingnetwork.com/video/how-to-cut-a-road-bike-steerer-tube) as presented by the Global Cycling Network. After trying out the desired stem height I draw a line with a pencil around the 5 mm spacer that sits on top of the stem. Then I take away the wheels and disassemble the fork from the bike frame.

1. For the compression bung to work properly I have to cut away additional 3 mm. Make sure it´s exactly 3 mm as cutting only 2 additional mil will lead to the compression bung not function.. 
   <figure>
   <img src="/img/sports/steerer-cut-lines.jpg" alt="A steerer tube with three pencil lines to identify the final cut line">
   <figcaption>On this image you see three lines on the steerer. From top to bottom: 
   <ul>
   <li>A thin line going aroung the steerer. That was my first line before noticing that I should take away one of the headset shims for a tighter seal.</li>
   <li>A thicker line going around the steerer. That is the top height of the final 5 mm spacer that sits on top of the stem.</li>
   <li>A very short line. That is the cut mark that must be 3 mm below the top spacer height.</li>
   </ul></figcaption>
   </figure>
2. I put a very short Tesa tape to mask the cut line and above and overlapping the short tape another Tesa around the entire steerer to improve the cut.
   <figure>
   <img src="/img/sports/cut-prepared-steerer.jpg" alt="">
   <figcaption>The two Tesa tapes on top of each other and an additional pencil lines to identify the cut mark easily</figcaption>
   </figure>
3. The saw blade guide can be attached to the steerer just so that cut will go through the identified cut line.
   <figure>
   <img src="/img/sports/saw-blade-guide.jpg" alt="">
   <figcaption>The saw blade guide attached to the steerer</figcaption>
   </figure>
4. It´s time to cut the steerer with the hacksaw. I´ve attached the Park Tool Carbon Blade to my plain old 300 mm hacksaw for the cutting. I´m wearing an FFP2 mask (easy to have one at hand during a pandemic) and I should have worn Nitril gloves (which I didn´t do). Because I do not own a vice I´m sitting down, laying the fork on my knees and do the sawing. Admittedly, it would be better to mount the sawing guide into a vice for this job. After the cut is made, I do some gentle sandpaper grinding of the cutting area. I use a sanding block and P120 sandpaper. Finally I remove the Tesa tape from the steerer.

5. The result is an even and smooth steerer cut.
