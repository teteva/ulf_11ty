## Fairlight Cycles
My first contact with the Fairlight Strael was through [road.cc](https://road.cc/content/review/216171-fairlight-cycles-strael), around 2017, when Stu Kerton reviewed the bike and gave it an excellent rating.

<blockquote>
<p>Taking everything into account, the Strael is pretty hard to knock, especially for the non-racer. If you want a bike you can train on, bimble about on, credit card tour on, or just get out there and wring the neck of for a full-on blast around the lanes while enjoying each and every mile, the Fairlight ticks all of the boxes.</p>
<p>A truly stunning four-season machine with an infectious grin factor and amazing handling.</p>

I was not particularly interested in a steel bike, actually I was far away of it. It was more out of curiosity that I wanted to know why someone would consider an *old school steel bike* as being top of the range, even compared to modern carbon bikes.^[At the time I was riding a Rose Carbon XEON Team GF 57cm frame with SRAM Red and Mavic Cosmic Carbon Pro wheels. Still, in 2021, the Rose is my road bike and I´m very satisfied with the Rose. Also, the service you get from Rose is top. I had never any reason to complain.] 

The ride quality seemed to be impressive. Fast, direct, yet comfortable to be used as an endurance bike. The next thing to check was the geometry and that´s where the story started lifting off for me. [Fairlight](https://fairlightcycles.com) is a small bike brand based in London, founded by Dom Thomas and Jon Reid. All their bikes are designed around *[Proportional Geometry](https://fairlightcycles.com/proportional-geometry/)*, which means you can have each frame size in a *regular* and a *tall* option. That´s something I don´t see with other brands, even the big ones. The fact that Dom Thomas, the bike designer, is taking so much care about rider needs cannot be over-emphasized in my view. 🙌 

Their *tall* frame option is for people with long legs and short torso, while the *regular* is for people with short legs and long torso (or, regular legs and regular torso 😊). I would say *regular* reflects the typical road bike geometry. I fall into the *tall* category, which means I have difficulties riding a standard road race bike. Only marathon geometries, with shorter top tubes and taller head tubes, work for me. And even then I have to tune the bike with 90mm stem instead of 100mm and using drop bars with a reach around 70 to 75mm. Everything else means I have less joy riding longer distances, not to mention marathons like the [Rhoen Marathon](https://www.rhoen-radmarathon.dehttps://www.rhoen-radmarathon.de), which is something I like doing on a road bike.

Now, imagine how lucky I was to see that a *tall* Fairlight frame would do that: shorten the top tube and extending the head tube while keeping excellent frame handling. As I wrote before: that was when I was getting hooked into Fairlight, though there are [some other bikes](/2021-08-05-bike-geos/) I find interesting for that very reason.

Once the first contact was made, I took attention about what else was going on with Fairlight. The next thing I noticed was [James Hayden](https://jamesmarkhayden.eu) riding a Strael during the [Transcontinental](https://www.transcontinental.cc) race – and winning it! James won the race two times, on a Strael, in 2017 and 2018. His reasoning for the bike was: For a self-supported 3500km race to be ridden within around nine days, sitting 400km a day on a bike means you need a comfortable and yet capable bike to be competitive.^[James Hayden´s Fairlight Strael for the 2017 Transcontinental on [road.cc](https://road.cc/content/tech-news/227259-transcontinental-race-2017-winner-james-haydens-fairlight-strael
)] ^[James Hayden´s Fairlight Strael for the 2018 Transcontinental on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIsuG8agZDI) and [road.cc](https://road.cc/content/tech-news/246373-james-hayden-wins-transcontinental-race-second-year-running-fairlight)] 

To me it was prove enough the Strael steel frame had more to it than cycling folklore.

## The frame

It took me four years from there to the point of ordering a Strael frame in late August 2021 to build up my personal bike. In particular, it´s a Strael because of

- **The fit:** There is a *tall* frame geometry that fits me. Have a look at the [Fairlight Fit Calculator](https://fairlightcycles.com/calculator/).
- **The details:** When you read through Dom´s [design notes](https://fairlightcycles.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Fairlight-Strael-3.0-Design-Notes.pdf) you´ll get a sense of how he is taking care about everything. It´s speaking to me and I enjoy owning a frame someone was so humble and courageous about.
- **The durability:** I think a steel frame can take the everyday use better than a carbon frame.
- **The ride:** Unfortunately, I couldn´t do a test ride before ordering the frame. I´m relying on how certain riders describe it. Therefore I´m talking here about my expectations. The Strael is now in its third model iteration and according to how it´s described it got even better with each iteration. It´s comfortable, it climbs, it gets to speed, the handling is balanced. Stu Kerton´s characterization resonates with me. He describes what I like about a road bike – comfort without being mushy, predictability without being twitchy, and pedaling performance.

	<blockquote><p>The comfort levels are absolutely spot on and well balanced too. When you are seated, regardless of pace, the rear end really takes the bumps and vibrations out of the road; the racer becomes a cruiser.</p>
  <p>…</p>
  <p>Everything you need to know is coming through the frame and fork from the tyres, and it's this level of interaction that allows you to ride the Fairlight as though it's a much more performance-orientated bike than it is.</p>
  <p>Slightest inputs from shifting your bodyweight or tweaking the steering, have such an instantaneous and positive feeling on how the bike behaves. It's just so precise, especially considering that the geometry is aimed more at the relaxed, endurance end of the spectrum.</p>
  <p>All this adds up to a feeling of the Strael being an extension of you as a rider. Downhill technical sections are just such a blast – the Fairlight flows from bend to bend in such a controlled manner.</p>
  <p>It's hard to get over just how much in tune with everything the Strael is. Regardless of the road conditions or the state of the surface, this thing is nailed on, composed and gives massive confidence to you as a rider.</p>

  </blockquote>   
   
  Honestly, all that is too good to be true. But how many bikes do you know that receive a 10 out of 10 rating on road.cc? 
  
  To be more complete, there are other reviews of the different design iterations of the Strael, like [<cite>Fairlight Cycles Strael 2.0</cite>](https://road.cc/content/review/240016-fairlight-cycles-strael-20) in 2020, again by Stu Kerton. Jack Luke did a [<cite>Fairlight Strael 3.0 review</cite>](https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/fairlight-strael-3-0-review/) on bikeradar, with a rating of 5 out of 5. Another one is from David Arthur below.

- **The sophistication:** Tubes are made by Reynolds in Birmingham, England. Frames are hand-built in Taiwan. Each tube is formed with an intentionally choosen steel. Custom 0.7/0.4/0.7 [Reynolds 853](https://www.reynoldstechnology.biz/materials/steel/s-853/) top tube, 20 x 30mm oval. Custom 0.75/0.45/0.75 Reynolds 853 down tube, 30 x 40mm bi-oval. [Reynolds 725](https://www.reynoldstechnology.biz/materials/steel/s-725/) 22.2mm custom formed chainstays with 0.8/0.6mm butting. Those chainstays have a very complex form to accomplish excellent power transfer while still providing comfort. Reynolds 725 14mm non-taper seat stays with 0.6mm wall thickness. The head tube is 4130 chromoly CNC machined from a solid billet into a tube. The dropouts are CNC machined single pieces and can be replaced.  It´s no question to me that this frame is high sophisticated and the ride quality seems to justify the thoughts and effort.
- **The standards:** The frame has standard thru axles with 12x100mm front and 12x142mm rear, as well as an english – what else? – threaded 68mm bottom bracket ^[[<cite>The complete guide to bottom bracket standards</cite>](https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-complete-guide-to-bottom-bracket-standards/)] ^[The threaded english bottom bracket standard also <q>goes by other names, but they all mean the same thing. These are: BSA, BSC, BC, ISO, British, and Euro, the name used in BMX bike circles. The term BSA stands for Birmingham Small Arms, a British company that produced bicycles, cars and other durable goods. The term BSC stands for British Standard Cycle, which adopted the same standard. BSC is sometimes shortened to BC. The term ISO is refers to the International Standard Organization, which also adopted this same standard to be the ISO standard.</q> Source: [<cite>Bottom bracket standards and terminology</cite>](https://www.parktool.com/blog/repair-help/bottom-bracket-standards-and-terminology)], a 27.2mm seatpost, and maximum 160mm disc rotors front and rear (flatmount). It´s compatible with all double road chainsets, 46T max single. SHIS headset ZS44/28.6 | EC44/40.
- **The versatility:** Whether it´s the CNC machined replaceable dropout design, the cable mounting guides, the bottle mounts for three bottles, internal light cable routing for dynamo lights (drive and non-drive side), internal DI2 routing, or 36mm tyre clearance: it makes the bike very adjustable to all sorts of play. There are also mudguard eyelets, which I think I will not use, but for some it might be a huge advantage.
- **The look and finish:** You can see each tube and how it´s designed to function. Everything is at display. There is no bling bling just for the sake of it. The frame has a timeless look. I like the *putty* frame color and – new to the Strael 3.0 – the Anraed fork in frame color. The Fairlight logo is beautiful too.

There is one thing left, *the weight of a steel frame.* The frame of the current Strael 3.0 weighs around 2200g, that´s including bolts, rear axle and dropout inserts, but without the fork. Say, a modern first class carbon frame will weigh under 1000g, then the Strael frame is *at least* 1200g heavier than a carbon frame. For me it was not something to easily take without consideration, but all the advantages from above outweigh the weight in my view.

## The groupset

My original plan was to have a mechanical groupset on the bike because I dislike taking care of proper battery charging just to shift gears. Also the environmental impact of batteries is something I prefer to avoid. For the very long term perspective there might be a reliability drawback of electronic shifting: Would a 15 year old electronic groupset still perform as well as a 15 year old mechanical groupset? At least the battery (or batteries) need to be replaced. The derailleurs of electronic groupsets are much more complex than mechanical ones, so there is a greater chance of something breaking. When touring, you have a chance to repair a mechanical groupset by yourself. Forget about that with an electronic groupset.

With Shimano presenting their new Dura Ace and Ultegra groupsets in 2021, the current first tier and second tier groupsets of Shimano and SRAM are shifting electronically, and nothing else. It seems there is no path into the future for mechanical shifting anymore. Electronic shifting has become faster, more accurate, and more comfortable than mechanical shifting. The rider experience is improved if everything works well – and sure, things work well most of the time. 

I started thinking about electronic groupsets.

### Electronic shifting 

- **SRAM´s eTap AXS** shifting is wireless. The bike will only need brake hoses and no cables for shifting. It´s quick to set up and the gearing range is absolutely interesting, with smaller chainrings front and a small 10 teeth sprocket on the cassette, which makes a broader gearing range. The smaller chainrings will lead to riding more often on the big chainring, which leads to less changing gears on the front. SRAM has been a huge innovator in the bike industry and when they bring something new it´s always interesting to look at it. I like almost everything about their groupsets, except, you have to take care of the charging status of four batteries. Each derailleur has its own battery, which should last for 400 km of riding. A battery can be charged within 60 minutes and for that reason the battery will be removed from the bike and put into a charging cradle. Keep in mind, each derailleur has its own battery, they are both the same, so they can be interchanged, but there are two of them. In addition, each brake lever has a CR2032 battery to be able to send the wireless signals to the derailleurs. The shifter batteries should last for two years. Four batteries with each one a different charging status is something that scares me off. On the other hand, replacing a battery is super quick and because they are small and of low weight, carrying a replacement part on longer rides is doable.
- **Shimano´s Di2** shifting approach is still mostly wired. There is a central battery that will be placed inside of the seatpost, which hides away and protects the battery. Both derailleurs are wired to the battery and a fully charged system would allow for around 1000 km of riding. Even if it´s less or more than 1000 km, the Di2 battery will allow to ride at least double as far than the eTap AXS batteries before charging is required. To charge the battery, the rear dearailleur needs to get wired to a power supply, which means the entire bike needs to be near a power supply. There is the option to wire the brake levers with the central battery, which I prefer because then there´s only one battery in the system with a clear charging status. This option is claimed to even prolongue battery life by 50% and to speed up shifting. The other option is to use the brake levers with batteries for a wireless connection from the levers to the derailleurs, which add´s two more batteries, shortens life of the central battery, and it makes shifting slower. Shifting of SRAM is good but shifting of Shimano works better, no matter if wireless or wired. While each system is a joy to use, Shimano is the fastest and most accurate. 
- **Campagnolo** has never been an option for me, because I dislike their brake lever ergonomics.

> When deciding for an electronic shifting system, I lean towards Shimano for the following reasons: Di2 can be set up to have a single central battery for the entire system, which makes it easy to have a clear charging status. The battery has double the capacity of the SRAM batteries, and Shimano shifts faster and more accurate.

### Weight

In the below table I´m considering shifters and brakes, derailleurs, batteries, cassette and chain. I do not include the crankset, because I will use a different one.

### Cost


## The crankset

Being able to route Di2 wires through the Strael frame requires a 24mm crankset axle and no larger. 24mm is the axle diameter used by Shimano, for that reason it wouldn´t be a problem to mount a standard Dura Ace or Ultegra crankset onto the frame – except, I do not like the crankset design too much and I would prefer to use sub-compact chainrings with 32-48 tooths. Being constraint to 24mm limits the number options options apart from Shimano. Basically I came to the Rotor cranksets, which allow a modular setup of different chainrings, even with Powermeter, look better in my opinion, and weigh less. See the weight comparison below. Please not that I only found the total weights of the Shimano cranksets without differentiating into their parts.
