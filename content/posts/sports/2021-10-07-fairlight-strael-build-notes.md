title: Fairlight Strael Build Notes

abstract: IÂ´m building up a new road bike. ItÂ´s based on a Fairlight Strael steel frame.

My first contact with the Strael was through [road.cc](https://road.cc/content/review/216171-fairlight-cycles-strael), around 2017 if I remember correctly, when Stu Kerton reviewed the bike and gave it an excellent rating.

<blockquote>
<p>Taking everything into account, the Strael is pretty hard to knock, especially for the non-racer. If you want a bike you can train on, bimble about on, credit card tour on, or just get out there and wring the neck of for a full-on blast around the lanes while enjoying each and every mile, the Fairlight ticks all of the boxes.</p>
<p>A truly stunning four-season machine with an infectious grin factor and amazing handling.</p>

I was not particularly interested in a steel bike, actually I was far away of it. It was more out of curiosity that I wanted to know why someone would consider an old school steel bike as being top of the range, even compared to modern carbon bikes.^[At the time I was riding a Rose Carbon XEON Team GF 57cm frame with SRAM Red and Mavic Cosmic Carbon Pro wheels. Still, in 2021, the Rose is my road bike and IÂ´m very satisfied with the Rose. Also, the service you get from Rose is top. I had never any reason to complain.] 

The ride quality seemed to be impressive. Fast, direct, yet comfortable. An endurance road bike. The next thing to check was the geometry and thatÂ´s where the story really started lifting off for me. [Fairlight](https://fairlightcycles.com) is a small bike brand based in London, founded by Dom Thomas and Jon Reid. All their bikes are designed around *[Proportional Geometry](https://fairlightcycles.com/proportional-geometry/)*, which means you can have each frame size in a *regular* and a *tall* option. ThatÂ´s something I donÂ´t see with other brands, even the big ones. The fact that Dom Thomas, the bike designer, is taking so much care about rider needs cannot be over-emphasized in my view. ðŸ™Œ 

Their *tall* frame option is for people with long legs and short torso, while the *regular* is for people with short legs and long torso. I would say *regular* reflects the typical road race bike geometry. I clearly fall into the *tall* category, which means I can hardly ride a standard road race bike. Only marathon geometries, with shorter top tubes and taller head tubes, work for me. And even then I have to tune the bike with 90mm stem instead of 100mm and using drop bars with a reach around 70 to 75mm. Everything else is creating back pain and I have no joy riding longer distances, not to mention marathons like the [Rhoen Marathon](https://www.rhoen-radmarathon.dehttps://www.rhoen-radmarathon.de), which is something I enjoy doing on a road bike.

Now, imagine how lucky I was to see that a *tall* Fairlight frame would do exactly that: shorten the top tube and extending the head tube while keeping excellent frame handling. As I wrote before: that was when I was getting hooked into Fairlight.

Once the first contact was made, I took attention about what else was going on with Fairlight. The next thing I noticed was [James Hayden](https://jamesmarkhayden.eu) riding a Strael during the [Transcontinental](https://www.transcontinental.cc) race â€“ and winning it! Actually, James won the race two times, on a Strael, in 2017 and 2018. His reasoning for the bike was: For self-supported 3500km race to be ridden within around nine days, sitting 400km a day on a bike means you need a comfortable and yet capable bike to be competitive.^[James HaydenÂ´s Fairlight Strael for the 2017 Transcontinental on [road.cc](https://road.cc/content/tech-news/227259-transcontinental-race-2017-winner-james-haydens-fairlight-strael

To me it was prove enough the Strael steel frame had more to it than cycling folklore.

It took me four years from there to the point of ordering a Strael frame to build up my own and personal bike. In particular, itÂ´s a Strael because of

<ul>
<li><strong>The fit:</strong> There is a <em>tall</em> frame geometry that fits me.</li>
<li><strong>The details:</strong> When you read through DomÂ´s <a href="https://fairlightcycles.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Fairlight-Strael-3.0-Design-Notes.pdf">design notes</a> youÂ´ll probably get a sense of how he is taking care about everything. ItÂ´s certainly speaking to me and I like to have a frame someone was so humble and courageous about.</li>
<li><strong>The durability:</strong> I think a steel frame can take the everyday use better than a carbon frame.</li>
<li><strong>The ride:</strong> Unfortunately, I couldnÂ´t do a test ride before ordering the frame. IÂ´m relying on how certain riders describe it. Therefore IÂ´m talking here about my expectations. The Strael is now in its third model iteration and according to how itÂ´s described it got even better with each iteration. ItÂ´s comfortable, it climbs well, it gets to speed well, the handling is very balanced. Stu KertonÂ´s characterization resonates with me. It describes what I like about a road bike â€“ comfort without being mushy, predictability without being twitchy, and pedaling performance.
<blockquote><p>The actual handling isn't as quick or sharp as a race bike, but because the Strael's frame is so responsive it isn't really an issue. The times on my favourite testing descents were pretty much the same on the Fairlight as with the carbon superbikes I've chucked down them over the years, some of which is down to how planted and confident the Strael feels, giving you the nod to maybe take a bit more risk.</p>
<p>â€¦</p>
<p>It all sounds a bit manic, doesn't it? But you don't have to ride the Strael like this all of the time, it's a cruiser too.</p>

There are other reviews of the subsequent design iterations of the Strael, which are the <a href="https://road.cc/content/review/240016-fairlight-cycles-strael-20">Strael 2.0</a> in 2020, and the <a href="https://road.cc/content/review/fairlight-strael-30-2021-284101">Strael 3.0</a> in 2021. All these reviews by Stu Kerton. Jack Luke did a review of the <a href="https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/fairlight-strael-3-0-review/">Strael 3.0</a> on bikeradar.com. Another one is from David Arthur below.

</li>
<li><strong>The standards:</strong> The frame has all the modern standards and a threaded 68mm bottom bracket.</li>
<li><strong>The versatility:</strong> Whether itÂ´s the CNC machined replaceable dropout design, the cable mounting guides, the bottle mounts for three bottles, or 36mm tyre clearance: it makes the bike very adjustable to all sorts of scenarios. There are also mudguard eyelets, which I think I will not use, but for some it might be a huge advantage.</li>
<li><strong>The look and finish:</strong> You see each tube and how itÂ´s designed to function. The frame has a timeless look. I like the <em>putty</em> frame color.</li>

There is one thing left, *the weight of a steel frame.* The frame of the current Strael 3.0 weighs around 2200g, thatÂ´s including bolts, rear axle and dropout inserts, but without the fork. As such, the frame is 1300g to 1400g heavier than a first class carbon frame. For me it was not something to easily take without consideration, but all the advantages from above outweight the weight.






Design is Everything. Steel bicycles inspired by funciton and utility.
