## Fairlight Cycles
My first contact with the Fairlight Strael was through [road.cc](https://road.cc/content/review/216171-fairlight-cycles-strael), around 2017, when Stu Kerton reviewed the bike and gave it an excellent rating.

<blockquote>
<p>Taking everything into account, the Strael is pretty hard to knock, especially for the non-racer. If you want a bike you can train on, bimble about on, credit card tour on, or just get out there and wring the neck of for a full-on blast around the lanes while enjoying each and every mile, the Fairlight ticks all of the boxes.</p>
<p>A truly stunning four-season machine with an infectious grin factor and amazing handling.</p>

I was not particularly interested in a steel bike, actually I was far away of it. It was more out of curiosity that I wanted to know why someone would consider an *old school steel bike* as being top of the range, even compared to modern carbon bikes.^[At the time I was riding a Rose Carbon XEON Team GF 57cm frame with SRAM Red and Mavic Cosmic Carbon Pro wheels. Still, in 2021, the Rose is my road bike and IÂ´m very satisfied with the Rose. Also, the service you get from Rose is top. I had never any reason to complain.] 

The ride quality seemed to be impressive. Fast, direct, yet comfortable to be used as an endurance bike. The next thing to check was the geometry and thatÂ´s where the story really started lifting off for me. [Fairlight](https://fairlightcycles.com) is a small bike brand based in London, founded by Dom Thomas and Jon Reid. All their bikes are designed around *[Proportional Geometry](https://fairlightcycles.com/proportional-geometry/)*, which means you can have each frame size in a *regular* and a *tall* option. ThatÂ´s something I donÂ´t see with other brands, even the big ones. The fact that Dom Thomas, the bike designer, is taking so much care about rider needs cannot be over-emphasized in my view. ðŸ™Œ 

Their *tall* frame option is for people with long legs and short torso, while the *regular* is for people with short legs and long torso (or, regular legs and regular torso ðŸ˜Š). I would say *regular* reflects the typical road race bike geometry. I clearly fall into the *tall* category, which means I can hardly ride a standard road race bike. Only marathon geometries, with shorter top tubes and taller head tubes, work for me. And even then I have to tune the bike with 90mm stem instead of 100mm and using drop bars with a reach around 70 to 75mm. Everything else is creating back pain and I have no joy riding longer distances, not to mention marathons like the [Rhoen Marathon](https://www.rhoen-radmarathon.dehttps://www.rhoen-radmarathon.de), which is something I enjoy doing on a road bike.

Now, imagine how lucky I was to see that a *tall* Fairlight frame would do exactly that: shorten the top tube and extending the head tube while keeping excellent frame handling. As I wrote before: that was when I was getting hooked into Fairlight, though there are [some other bikes](/2021-08-05-bike-geos/) I find interesting for that very reason.

Once the first contact was made, I took attention about what else was going on with Fairlight. The next thing I noticed was [James Hayden](https://jamesmarkhayden.eu) riding a Strael during the [Transcontinental](https://www.transcontinental.cc) race â€“ and winning it! Actually, James won the race two times, on a Strael, in 2017 and 2018. His reasoning for the bike was: For a self-supported 3500km race to be ridden within around nine days, sitting 400km a day on a bike means you need a comfortable and yet capable bike to be competitive.^[James HaydenÂ´s Fairlight Strael for the 2017 Transcontinental on [road.cc](https://road.cc/content/tech-news/227259-transcontinental-race-2017-winner-james-haydens-fairlight-strael
)] ^[James HaydenÂ´s Fairlight Strael for the 2018 Transcontinental on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIsuG8agZDI) and [road.cc](https://road.cc/content/tech-news/246373-james-hayden-wins-transcontinental-race-second-year-running-fairlight)] 

To me it was prove enough the Strael steel frame had more to it than cycling folklore.

## The frame

It took me four years from there to the point of ordering a Strael frame in late August 2021 to build up my personal bike. In particular, itÂ´s a Strael because of

- **The fit:** There is a *tall* frame geometry that fits me. Have a look at the [Fairlight Fit Calculator](https://fairlightcycles.com/calculator/).
- **The details:** When you read through DomÂ´s [design notes](https://fairlightcycles.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Fairlight-Strael-3.0-Design-Notes.pdf) youÂ´ll probably get a sense of how he is taking care about everything. ItÂ´s certainly speaking to me and I enjoy owning a frame someone was so humble and courageous about.
- **The durability:** I think a steel frame can take the everyday use better than a carbon frame.
- **The ride:** Unfortunately, I couldnÂ´t do a test ride before ordering the frame. IÂ´m relying on how certain riders describe it. Therefore IÂ´m talking here about my expectations. The Strael is now in its third model iteration and according to how itÂ´s described it got even better with each iteration. ItÂ´s comfortable, it climbs well, it gets to speed well, the handling is very balanced. Stu KertonÂ´s characterization resonates with me. He describes what I like about a road bike â€“ comfort without being mushy, predictability without being twitchy, and pedaling performance.

	<blockquote><p>The comfort levels are absolutely spot on and well balanced too. When you are seated, regardless of pace, the rear end really takes the bumps and vibrations out of the road; the racer becomes a cruiser.</p>
  <p>â€¦</p>
  <p>Everything you need to know is coming through the frame and fork from the tyres, and it's this level of interaction that allows you to ride the Fairlight as though it's a much more performance-orientated bike than it is.</p>
  <p>Slightest inputs from shifting your bodyweight or tweaking the steering, have such an instantaneous and positive feeling on how the bike behaves. It's just so precise, especially considering that the geometry is aimed more at the relaxed, endurance end of the spectrum.</p>
  <p>All this adds up to a feeling of the Strael being an extension of you as a rider. Downhill technical sections are just such a blast â€“ the Fairlight flows from bend to bend in such a controlled manner.</p>
  <p>It's hard to get over just how much in tune with everything the Strael is. Regardless of the road conditions or the state of the surface, this thing is nailed on, composed and gives massive confidence to you as a rider.</p>

  Honestly, all that is too good to be true. But how many bikes do you know that receive a 10 out of 10 rating on road.cc? 
  
  To be more complete, there are other reviews of the different design iterations of the Strael, like [<cite>Fairlight Cycles Strael 2.0</cite>](https://road.cc/content/review/240016-fairlight-cycles-strael-20) in 2020, again by Stu Kerton. Jack Luke did a [<cite>Fairlight Strael 3.0 review</cite>](https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/fairlight-strael-3-0-review/) on bikeradar, with a rating of 5 out of 5. Another one is from David Arthur below.

- **The sophistication:** Tubes are made in Birmingham, England. Frames are hand-built in Taiwan. Each tube is particularly formed with an intentionally choosen steel. The down tube is bi-ovalized and butted from Reynolds 853. The seat tube is butted 853. The top tube is ovalized and butted 853. The head tube is 4130 chromoly CNC machined from a solid billet into a tube. Seat tubes are non-taper Reynolds 725. Chain stays are butted Reynolds 725 and have a very complex form to accomplish excellent power transfer and still provide comfort. The dropouts are CNC machined single pieces and can be replaced. Honestly, I donÂ´t understand why itÂ´s made exactly this way, but itÂ´s no question to me that this frame is high sophisticated and the ride quality seems to justify the thoughts and effort.
- **The standards:** The frame has standard thru axles with 12x100mm front and 12x142mm rear, as well as an english â€“ what else? â€“ threaded 68mm bottom bracket ^[[<cite>The complete guide to bottom bracket standards</cite>](https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-complete-guide-to-bottom-bracket-standards/)] ^[The threaded english bottom bracket standard also <q>goes by other names, but they all mean the same thing. These are: BSA, BSC, BC, ISO, British, and Euro, the name used in BMX bike circles. The term BSA stands for Birmingham Small Arms, a British company that produced bicycles, cars and other durable goods. The term BSC stands for British Standard Cycle, which adopted the same standard. BSC is sometimes shortened to BC. The term ISO is refers to the International Standard Organization, an international standards organization, which also adopted this same standard to be the ISO standard.</q> Source: [<cite>Bottom bracket standards and terminology</cite>](https://www.parktool.com/blog/repair-help/bottom-bracket-standards-and-terminology)], a 27.2mm seatpost, and maximum 160mm disc rotors front and rear (flatmount). ItÂ´s compatible with all double road chainsets, 46T max single. SHIS headset ZS44/28.6 | EC44/40.
- **The versatility:** Whether itÂ´s the CNC machined replaceable dropout design, the cable mounting guides, the bottle mounts for three bottles, internal light cable routing for dynamo lights (drive and non-drive side), internal DI2 routing, or 36mm tyre clearance: it makes the bike very adjustable to all sorts of play. There are also mudguard eyelets, which I think I will not use, but for some it might be a huge advantage.
- **The look and finish:** You can see each tube and how itÂ´s designed to function. Everything is at display. There is no bling bling just for the sake of it. The frame has a timeless look. I like the *putty* frame color and â€“ new to the Strael 3.0 â€“ the Anraed fork in frame color. The Fairlight logo is beautiful too.

There is one thing left, *the weight of a steel frame.* The frame of the current Strael 3.0 weighs around 2200g, thatÂ´s including bolts, rear axle and dropout inserts, but without the fork. Say, a modern first class carbon frame will weigh under 1000g, then the Strael frame is *at least* 1200g heavier than a carbon frame. For me it was not something to easily take without consideration, but all the advantages from above outweight the weight, I believe.

## The groupset

My original plan was to have a mechanical groupset on the bike because I dislike taking care of proper battery charging just to shift gears. Also the environmental impact of batteries is something I prefer to avoid. For the very long term perspective there is also a reliability drawback of electronic shifing: Would a 15 year old electronic groupset still perform as well as a 15 year old mechanical groupset? At least the battery (or batteries) need be replaced. During touring, you have a chance to repair a mechanical groupset by yourself. Forget about that with an electronic groupset.

But, with Shimano presenting their new Dura Ace and Ultegra groupsets in 2021, all current first tier and second tier groupsets are only shifting electronically. It seems there is no path into the future for mechanical shifting anymore. 

Electronic shifting has become faster, more accurate, and more comfortable than mechanical shifting. The rider experience is improved if everything works well â€“ and sure, things work well most of the time. But to me not everything about electronic shifting is just positive.

I started thinking about electronic groupsets.
