With the upcoming [MacOS Sonoma](https://www.apple.com/macos/sonoma-preview/) Apple will allow to have Progressive Web Apps and normal websites to appear in the Dock and to be integrated into the operating system. Apple says <q>Use any website like an app.</q> IÂ´m looking forward to it.

> The out-of-the box launch experience of web apps is fantastic. Nowhere does it give away that this is a web app. For apps with a manifest, there's no Safari UI whatsoever, and the expectation is that such apps are single-page apps that provide their own navigation controls. If an app is well made, lay persons probably wouldn't be able to tell that something is a web app.

> Web apps in macOS Sonoma 14 Beta seamlessly integrate into the macOS experience, with no or very little visible Safari UI and with support for various operating system features.
