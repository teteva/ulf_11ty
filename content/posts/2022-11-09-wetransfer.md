You can share files with up to 2 GB of data for free with [<cite>WeTransfer</cite>](https://wetransfer.com). You do not need to sign up or sign in to use the service. WeTransfer is providing the service since 2009.

- Click into the settings (the three dots …)
- Choose to create a transfer link (I do not use the option to send a mail via WeTransfer because I don´t want to share any mail address with the service)
- Upload your files
- Copy the transfer link
- Send the link with your own mail

There are similar services. Among all of them, one alternative for me is [<cite>HiDrive Share</cite>](https://share.hidrive.com/) by german internet provider Strato. It offers similar features as WeTransfer, the servers are located in Germany and your data is secured by the German implementation of the European data protection laws (DSGVO), which are among the strictest in the world.
