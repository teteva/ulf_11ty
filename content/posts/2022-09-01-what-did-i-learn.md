title: What did I learn?

In a daily standup meeting, consider telling your team mates

> What did I learn since our last standup?

There is also other advice for structuring the daily standup, like

- What did I achieve since our last standup?
- What do I plan to achieve today?
- What is hindering me achieving our goal for the current interation?

All of that is not right. In a project situation where the team has to work through *a lot of* uncertainty answering the question <q>What did I learn?</q> might be more suitable at times. Still, don´t loose focus on what you want to achieve. E.g. when doing a daily Scrum, the Scrum Guide[^scrumguide] is saying:

<blockquote>
The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work. … The Developers can select whatever structure and techniques they want, as long as their Daily Scrum focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal and produces an actionable plan for the next day of work. This creates focus and improves self-management.

[^scrumguide]: I´m referring to what I believe is the official [<cite>2020 Scrum Guide</cite>](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#daily-scrum), by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland.
