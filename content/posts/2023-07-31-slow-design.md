title: Embrace trial and error

<blockquote>
A core characteristic of creating slowly is patience. Being patient with ourself to:
<ul>
<li>problem solve</li>
<li>become proficient at certain tooling</li>
<li>understand technologies and languages</li>
<li>think creatively</li>
<li>think critically</li>
<li>produce something of quality</li>
</ul>
Slow design is about embracing the time-consuming process of trial and error so we can figure out the most elegant, considered, and sustainable solution. 
When reflecting on an achievement, people often say that it's not the act of succeeding that's most satisfying. It's the process of getting there.
