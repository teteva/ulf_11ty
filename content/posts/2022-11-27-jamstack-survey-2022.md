[Astro](https://astro.build) is something I´m interested in for some time. This is a nudge. I find also noticable:

- [Why did you stay in your job?](https://jamstack.org/survey/2022/#why-did-you-stay-in-your-job) Number one: People stay if they like their team. Further reasons given, in that order:

	1. team
	2. being able to work remotely
	3. career growth
	4. company culture
	5. money
	6. corporate ethics
	7. my manager
	8. technology choices
	9. environmental impact

- [Why did you leave your job?](https://jamstack.org/survey/2022/#why-people-leave) People left voluntarily. Number one: Being able to work remotely. Further reasons given, in that order: 

	1. being able to work remotely in the new job
	2. career growth
	3. company culture
	4. team
	5. money
	6. my manager
	7. corporate ethics
	8. technology choices
	9. environmental impact.
