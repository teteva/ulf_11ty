	<dd>Emil used his new diving ring to exercise for the seahorse badge. That made a huge difference. Seeing the red ring underwater and trying to get it was a motivation booster. Also having proper goggles is helping a lot. At the end, Emil could dive deeper than required!</dd>

	<dd>In our todays swimming, for the first time Emil jumped into the water and swam more than the necessary 25 meters in a row. At the end he was surprised by how far he could get. Both of us are very proud.<div class="larger">🏊🤸</div></dd>

	<dd>Usually we swim in the mornings, but this time it was Sunday late afternoon. It was a relaxed session with ring diving, a bit of swimming and watersliding.</dd>

	<dd>Today we jumped from aside into the water and tried to swim the entire 25 meters. Ring diving was also on our list. We didn´t swim the full distance, probably 15 meters, but we did that multiple times. And Emil starts <em>using</em> the water instead of just trying to stay at the surface. All in all a very pleasant session.</dd>

	<dd>Again, jumping from aside, swimmig 15 meters multiple times, and diving.</dd>
