	<dd>Emil used his new diving ring to exercise for the seahorse badge. That made a huge difference. Seeing the red ring underwater and trying to get it was a motivation booster. Also having proper goggles is helping a lot. At the end, Emil could dive deeper than required!</dd>

	<dd>In our todays swimming, for the first time Emil jumped into the water and swam more than the necessary 25 meters in a row. At the end he was surprised by how far he could get. Both of us are very proud.<div class="larger">🏊🤸</div></dd>
