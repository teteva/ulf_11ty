[Syncthing](https://syncthing.net) is a tool to synchronize *multiple* folders between different computers with same or different operating systems. It is
- open source,
- the synchronized data is sent peer-to-peer, the data is not transferred across a centralized server, 
- the setup of the tool is a breeze, you will be surprised how quick and smooth,
- the syncing itself is quick and flawless.

ðŸ‘Œ The system is so good, you should give it a try! I got aware via the following tweet:

<blockquote>
ItÂ´s amazing how great computer products can be when they donÂ´t need to deal with corporate bullshit, donÂ´t have to promote a brand or to sell its users.
