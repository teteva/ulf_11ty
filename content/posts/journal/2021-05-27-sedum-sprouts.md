Yesterday our two flat roofs received their sedum sprouts. The quality work has been carried out by [Gartenbau Beil](https://www.gartengestaltung-beil.de). Now IÂ´m curious to see it growing ðŸŒ± while having a nice view every day. A rooftop is a hostile environment for plants, because itÂ´s getting very hot and there may be extended periods without any water. Also nutrients are limited. But sedum sprouts can deal with that.
