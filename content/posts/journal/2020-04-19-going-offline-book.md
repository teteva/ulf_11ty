*[Going Offline](https://abookapart.com/products/going-offline)* is following the same agenda as Jeremy does in his [talk](/2020-04-17-going-offline-video/). Of course, the book provides more background and details. It also contains a list of valuable resource links. Having watched the video of the talk before, I think it is an excellent next step on my quest to understand the groundwork of Progressive Web Apps.
