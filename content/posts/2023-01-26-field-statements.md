Statements are better than questions when labeling fields because it is less to read and the important details are front-loaded. Also: Avoid instructions like ‘Enter...’, ‘Select...’, ‘Tell us about...’ because it’s wordier and usually unnecessary. See the two tweets, and the videos within the tweets, by Adam Silver:
