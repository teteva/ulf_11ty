[<cite>Good Services</cite>](https://good.services/home) is a book by Lou Down, who is the founder of The School of Good Services. Lou spent six years in the UK Government establishing the cross-government standards for good services. 

How did I come to read this book? The UK Government is known by web folks because of their excellent [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) which is a posterchild for this kind of work. 

Lou Downe´s book is not about web design systems. It touches the web because todays services have to be designed to work well on the internet and for that reason Lou´s book is important for web people. Knowing about the GOV.UK Design System and knowing that Lou worked in the UK Government to define service standards was reason enough for me to be curious about the book. Lou´s book is also praised by Adam Silver who is one of the designers behind the GOV.UK Design System and who has written an excellent book on [<cite>Form Design Patterns</cite>](https://formdesignpatterns.com/). 

Below are my notes about Good Services, which are mostly quotes from the book.

## What is a service

Services are the things that connect other things, like choosing a new car and having it delivered. *We barely notice them until we encounter something that stands out as good or bad.* They exist in the background by their nature. For the organizations that provide them, services are often barely more visible than they are for their users. Sometimes there are so many pieces to this puzzle, or they stretch across such a long period of time, that we struggle to see them as a whole. And yet it´s services that are the interface of so much of our experience of the world. From having children, getting married, moving house and, ultimately, death, services facilitate some of the most important moments in our lives.

Services are often hugely affected by the channel in which they´re designed to be provided. There are three things that have influenced our understanding of services more than anything else: 

1. The invention of the postal service
2. The telephone
3. The internet
