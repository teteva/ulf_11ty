[<cite>Good Services</cite>](https://good.services/home) is a book by Lou Down, who is the founder of The School of Good Services. Lou spent six years in the UK Government establishing the cross-government standards for good services. Did you know that about 80% of the cost of UK Government is spent on services? Of the 10,000 recorded services, some are over 200 years old. Again 60% of the cost of these services is spent on service failure – phone calls asking government how to do something, or pieces of casework where forms aren´t filled in correctly.

How did I come to read this book? The UK Government is known by web folks because of their excellent [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) which is a posterchild for this kind of work. 

Lou Downe´s book is not about web design systems. It touches the web because todays services have to be designed to work well on the internet and for that reason Lou´s book is important for web people. Knowing about the GOV.UK Design System and knowing that Lou worked in the UK Government to define service standards was reason enough for me to be curious about the book. Lou´s book is also praised by Adam Silver who is one of the designers behind the GOV.UK Design System and who has written an excellent book on [<cite>Form Design Patterns</cite>](https://formdesignpatterns.com/). 

Below are my notes about Good Services, which are mostly quotes from the book.

## What is a service?

Services are the things that connect other things, like choosing a new car and having it delivered. In this sense a service is not a product – like the car in the previous example. *We barely notice them until we encounter something that stands out as good or bad.* They exist in the background by their nature. For the organizations that provide them, services are often barely more visible than they are for their users. Sometimes there are so many pieces to this puzzle, or they stretch across such a long period of time, that we struggle to see them as a whole. And yet it´s services that are the interface of so much of our experience of the world. From having children, getting married, moving house and, ultimately, death, services facilitate some of the most important moments in our lives.

Services are often hugely affected by the channel in which they´re designed to be provided. There are three things that have influenced our understanding of services more than anything else: 

1. The invention of the postal service
2. The telephone
3. The internet
Regardless of how your service is consumed, the internet is where your users start, probably on their own and probably on a mobile device. Google (or an equivalent search engine) will be where they start, and then on to homepage to your service. Users will start looking for what they need, not what you´ve decided they need. If what they find is something that doesn´t match, or requires prior knowledge to be able to use, they will go elsewhere if they can.

The only person who gets to decide what the servcie is, is the person who has the goal they need to achieve – and that´s your user.

## What makes a good service?

A better service for users is generally a better service for an organization to supply. By not designing our services, we´re accepting that they will evolve to the conditions around them, regardless of whether or not that means a service meets user needs, is financially sustainable or achieves a certain outcome.

Service failure is hidden in wrongly worded questions, broken links and poorly trained staff; in emails not sent, phone lines that have been closed or inaccessible PDFs. Each time we decide to incentivise our staff, change a policy, open or a close channel or buy a new piece of technology, we make a decision that will have an impact on the quality of the service *for a user.* We need to turn these everyday decisions into *conscious design decisions.*

Making something good for users is completely dependent on making something good for your organization and for the world as a whole.

It´s almost impossible to build a service that is good for the user if it´s not good for your organization, and, likewise, if that thing isn´t sustainable, it´s not likely to deliver long-term value.

Good services are:

- **Good for the user:** It does what *they need to do,* in a way that *works for them.*
- **Good for the organization providing it:** It´s profitable and easy to run.
- **Good for society as a whole:** It does not destroy the world we live in, or negatively affect the socienty as a whole.

## 15 principles of good service design

### A good service is easy to find

A service must be able to be found by a user with no prior knowledge of the task they set out to do. Google is the homepage of your service. Whether the service is usable online or not.

1. When it comes to finding a service, nothing is more important that its name.
2. The name should reflect what the users are trying to do. Good services are verbs, bad services are nouns. Nouns are for experts, verbs are for everyone. 
3. Use words that your users will understand. Avoid legal or technical language (use *help with court fees* and not *fee remissions*). Describe a task, not a technology (not *portal, hub, e-something, i-something*). Don´t use acronyms.

### A good service clearly explains its purpose

The purpose of the service must be clear to users at the start of using the service. A user with no prior knowledge must understand what the service will do for them and how it will work.

Communicate the purpose of your service by telling your users

- what your service does
- why it does it
- how it does it
- who it´s for

### A good service sets the expectations a user has of it
