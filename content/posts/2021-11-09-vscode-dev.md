title: Use Visual Studio Code in the Browser

How great is that? Now we can use VS Code in the Browser by navigating to [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev). It´s possible to create and edit documents in GitHub repositories as well as working with local files. 

> You can create a new file in the web just as you would in a desktop VS Code environment, using File > New File from the Command Palette (F1).

See the [announcement](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2021/10/20/vscode-dev). There are [limitations](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/vscode-web). You wouldn´t have a Terminal window, for example, but editing something on your blog just inside your GitHub repository works much better now.
