I think, yes.

> Good web developers, on the other hand, don't just build websites, they push the boundaries of the web as a medium. They try new things, experiment with new interfaces, hack around, try to produce novelty. Even if their experiments don't make it onto a hard-nosed production site, they learn tricks that are useful, and each site they build is better than the last. They aren't building websites, they are developing the web.
