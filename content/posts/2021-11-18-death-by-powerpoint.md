My takes from the presentation:

1. **One message per slide (not more).** With more than one message per slide the audience will not remember any of the messages. 
2. **Use short text.** A lengthy text message (a sentence, a paragraph) on the slide while talking at the same time is creating two messages and the audience will not remember any of the messages.
3. **The most important information must be the biggest on the slide.** We are focusing on moving objects, big objects, high contrast, and alerting colors.
4. **Grey out.** Make the important information high contrast and grey out the unimportant, e.g. when walking through a bullet-list, give high contrast to the current bullet only.
5. **Dark background.** A white background is shifting away focus from the speaker. *The speaker is the presentation* and PowerPoint is the presentation aid. 
6. **Have six objects on the slide.** More objects force people into counting instead of seeing, which makes people needing *five times more energy* to follow the presentation.
