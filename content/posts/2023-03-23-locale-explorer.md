A colleague introduced the [Locale Explorer](https://icu4c-demos.unicode.org/icu-bin/locexp). We used it to have examples of how content, like dates, numbers, decimals, and currencies, is formatted in different locales with specific settings for the formatting. You wouldn´t believe it, there even is a locale [ksh-DE](https://icu4c-demos.unicode.org/icu-bin/locexp?d_=de&_=ksh_DE), which stands for the Kölsch language in Germany.
