[<cite>Manrope</cite>](https://manropefont.com), by [Mikhail Sharanda](https://gent.media), is a free and variable sans serif font. At first I thought itÂ´s good for screen interface, but the Il1 coe test is not ideal.

<figcaption>The <a href="/2021-02-07-how-to-pick-a-typeface-for-interface-text/">il1 coe</a> test of Manrope to distinguish letters is not ideal. The letters Il1 are very close to each other and the apertures could be more open to qualify for screen interface usage.</figcaption>

Mikhail describes his font like:

>	This font is a crossover of different font types: it is semi-condensed, semi-rounded, semi-geometric, semi-din, semi-grotesque. It employs minimal stroke thickness variations and a semi-closed aperture. The fourth version of the font comes in a Variable Font format, and 7 legacy weights.
