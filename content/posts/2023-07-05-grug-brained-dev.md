[<cite>The Grug Brained Developer</cite>](https://grugbrain.dev) is so good!

> complexity bad
> say again:
> complexity very bad
> you say now:
> complexity very, very bad
> given choice between complexity or one on one against t-rex, grug take t-rex: at least grug see t-rex
> complexity is spirit demon that enter codebase through well-meaning but ultimately very clubbable non grug-brain developers and project managers who not fear complexity spirit demon or even know about sometime
> one day code base understandable and grug can get work done, everything good!
> next day impossible: complexity demon spirit has entered code and very dangerous situation!
> best weapon against complexity spirit demon is magic word: "no"
> "no, grug not build that feature"
> "no, grug not build that abstraction"
> "no, grug not put water on body every day or drink less black think juice you stop repeat ask now"
