title: Per file commit logs for blog posts
tags: code

While reading the wonderful posts of David McCormic on his site [dmc.omg.lol](https://dmc.omg.lol/posts/) (what a domain), I found David has a log of the Git commits at the bottom of each post. That´s interesting! David is referencing Max Kohler´s article [Per-file commit logs with Eleventy](https://www.maxkohler.com/posts/per-file-commit-history-with-eleventy/), where the technical solution is explained. I think the solution is not limited to 11ty. It would probably work in any Node.js environment, because [Simple Git](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-git) is used to get the Git commit log for each post.

It makes me happy to find two interesting bloggers, during one evening, and as a bonus, both have an RSS feed!
