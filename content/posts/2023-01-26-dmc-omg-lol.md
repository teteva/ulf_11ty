While reading the wonderful posts of David McCormic on his site [dmc.omg.lol](https://dmc.omg.lol/posts/), I found David has a log of the git commits in an update section at the bottom of each post. That´s interesting! David is referencing Max Kohler´s article [Per-file commit logs with Eleventy](https://www.maxkohler.com/posts/per-file-commit-history-with-eleventy/), where the technical solution is explained. 

That makes me happy. I found two interesting bloggers, during one evening, and as a bonus, both have an RSS feed!
