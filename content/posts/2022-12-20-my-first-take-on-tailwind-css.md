title: My first try with Tailwind CSS

During the last two weeks I switched the CSS for {{site.name}} to Tailwind CSS. Some years ago I got drawin into utility-first CSS when I saw [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io) for the first time. Utility-first CSS means *self-descriptive, single-purpose CSS classes,* like:

```css
.hidden {
	display: none;
}
```

I find utility-first CSS classes particulary useful in conjunction with media-variants that reflrect on things like screen size or dark mode and light mode.
