Over the weekend my homepage received a new domain. While the old address **ulf.codes** is still functioning, the new address is **ulfschneider.io**.

This didnÂ´t start as a domain change. At first I *only* wanted to make my site faster by delegating the DNS from Strato to Netlify. My site is a [Jamstack](/2022-09-28-jamstack-in-20-minutes/) site hosted by Netlify and therefore letting them manage the DNS will make any site much faster in most cases. ThatÂ´s because when someone wants to navigate to your website, Netlify knows from what area of the world your visitor is coming and they will leverage their Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve your website from a datacenter nearest to your visitor. The impact is drastic. In my case, and in the environment I was measuring, page load improved from 1.2 s down to 0.6 s â€“ all free of cost and without changing your build process.

While I was working with name servers and DNS settings, I found the ulfschneider.io domain was available and I immediately reserved it with the idea of changing the primary domain for my blog to ulfschneider.io over the weekend â€“ of course while keeping the site functioning for everyone who is used to the old address ulf.codes.

Here are a some quick notes of how both changes were accomplished, the DNS change as well as the primary domain change.

## Use the Netlify name servers for ðŸš€ speed

I found the [Netlify documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/netlify-dns/) to be straightforward for doing the job. My domain ulf.codes was registered with Strato, which means from the perspective of Netlify it is an *external domain.* The Netlify documentation states:

> To add a domain you have already registered elsewhere:
> 
> 1. Go to your teamâ€™s **Domains** page and select **Add or register domain**.
> 2. Enter the domain you wish to add and select **Verify**.
> 3. You will be asked to confirm that you are the owner of the domain. Select **Yes, add domain** to create a Netlify DNS zone for the domain.

This step will not do any real changes, except creating two entries in your Netlify domain settings of type NETLIFY.

Now you have the option to add DNS records within your Netlify settings. In my case, I have an email address  mail@ulf.codes and a mailbox hosted by Strato. Once I delegate my DNS administration from Strato to Netlify that mail address should still be functional. Therefore, *before delegating,* I had to create an MX DNS record in my Netlify settings to point to the Strato mail server.

I didnÂ´t knew the name of my providers mail server, therefore I visited [whatsmydns.net/dns-lookup/](https://www.whatsmydns.net/dns-lookup/), entered my domain ulf.codes, clicked **Search**, and under **MX** were the values I had to transfer into my Netlify MX configuration.

It was not required for my case to create any more DNS records at Netlify, therefore by then I was ready to delegate my domain from Strato to Netlify. I did that in in the Strato domain administration for ulf.codes by telling Strato to use the four Netlify name servers instead of Strato name servers for the domain lookup. The four Netlify name servers again are listed within your Netlify domain settings.

After storing the NS records at Strato, all other Strato settings for the ulf.codes domain were marked as *not active* by Strato. It can take several hours until the new NS settings are replicated around the world. In my case it took roughly 3 hours. But then my site was on full speed! ThatÂ´s because when you use Netlify name servers Netlify knows from what region of the world a user is requesting your website and they will serve the contents from a datacenter that is closest to your user. The impact is bigger than you might think. Have a look at the current load times for ulf.codes at [testmysite.io](https://testmysite.io/637a79d4ccca0b63641bb7ed/ulf.codes). I could only achieve that with Netlify. ==Before using the Netlify name servers a full download of the HTML would take 145 ms in Germany, now its down to 4 ms!==


## Have an additional domain 

Letting your Netlify site run unter multiple domains is also possible. Again, the Netlify documentation
