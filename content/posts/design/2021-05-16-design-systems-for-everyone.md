Ethan Marcotte has [four new courses on design systems](https://thegymnasium.com/design-systems), available for free at Aquent Gymnasium. These are my notes about the first course, *[Design systems for everyone](https://thegymnasium.com/design-systems#everyone)*.

## Introduction

- Design systems bring *structure* and *purpose* to design patterns. 
- Design systems help to make patterns more visible and more organized. 
- Design systems can help make our products more manageable and consistent. 
- *Design systems can help to communicate more clearly.*

## What is a design system

Examples

- [Olympic Games 1972 Munich, by Otl Aicher](https://www.munich72collected.com/)
- [Mailchimp](https://ux.mailchimp.com/patterns)
- [IBM Carbon Design System](https://carbondesignsystem.com)
- [Starbucks Pattern Library](https://starbucks.com/developer/pattern-library) complemented by [Our new expression](https://creative.starbucks.com)
- [Salesforce Lightning Design System](https://lightningdesignsystem.com)
- Further information at [Alla Kholmatova](https://craftui.com)
    
A design system consists of patterns & components as well as guidelines how to work with those patterns.

## Why do we need design systems

- *Design patterns* are reusable pieces or solution of interface design.
- A *pattern library* is a well-structured and accessible collection of patterns. Often managed by software such as Storybook, Pattern Lab, or Fractal. A *good* pattern library meets the needs of the people using it. It has to be *accessible to them.* Which means it has to be organized, categorized, and navigable. Also, *teams have to be able to contribute to the pattern library.*

A design system provides *designers, developers, and product managers* a shared language to improve on the following things:

- design standards
- consistency
- less redundancy
- an extensible system
- documentation
- coding standards
- improved shipping times

A design system is a way to improve the way your team works.
