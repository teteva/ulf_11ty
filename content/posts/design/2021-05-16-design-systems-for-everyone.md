Ethan Marcotte has [four new courses on design systems](https://thegymnasium.com/design-systems), available for free at Aquent Gymnasium. These are my notes about the first course, *[Design systems for everyone](https://thegymnasium.com/design-systems#everyone)*.

1. **Introduction** 
    - Design systems bring *structure* and *purpose* to design patterns. 
    - Design systems help to make patterns more visible and more organized. 
    - Design systems can help make our products more manageable and consistent. 
    - *Design systems can help to communicate more clearly.*
2. **What is a design system** Examples

    > A design system consists of patterns & components as well as guidelines how to work with those patterns.
