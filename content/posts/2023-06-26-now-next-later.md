A roadmap planning categorized into

1. Now
2. Next
3. Later

makes sense to me. The NNL roadmap gives room to adjust your plan and respond to uncertainty, while still focusing on what to achieve in the near term. ItÂ´s also easy to understand, which is important if you want to share the same mental model about your roadmap. It is not meant to have deadlines attached to it.
