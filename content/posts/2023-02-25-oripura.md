I bought a laptop stand. It´s a piece of kit I never owned, nor used before. It´s a foldable [Oripura](https://www.colebrookbossonsaunders.com/accessories/oripura/) and I chose it because I liked the idea of folding it away from the desk when it´s not in use. I think it works pretty well in lifting up the laptop screen to a more ergonomic position. The Oripura comes packed in a letter-like envelop, so it´s save to say folding works flawlessly.
