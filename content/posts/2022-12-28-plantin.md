[<cite>Plantin</cite>](https://catalog.monotype.com/family/monotype/plantin) by Monotype is such a beautiful serif old style typeface. I like especially the plain roman and the expressive italic styles. I came across when visiting the homepage of [Ash Huang](https://ashsmash.com). Plantin in use can be found at [typewolf](https://www.typewolf.com/plantin). Because it has thicker letterforms than usual it is probably best suited for display text.
