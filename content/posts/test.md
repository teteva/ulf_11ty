title: Scrum and Architecture
abstract: Cooperatively making architecture decisions, at a point in time when they are needed, and not earlier, is a quality-improving paradigm in agile software development. Conceptual integrity in the flow of architecture decisions will only be achieved if one person has the final word regarding those decisions. This is the architect, whose rights and obligations in the context of the Scrum process are being reflected in this essay.

Scrum is team-oriented and separates the delivery process into subsequent iterations, so-called Sprints. The question arises how an architecture with conceptual integrity, an architecture that is intuitively understandable for users, developers and operators, an architecture that is easy to use even after many iterations, can be achieved while the team is focusing on the microcosm and the solution patterns of current iterations.
