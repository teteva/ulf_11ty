A great talk by Jeremy Keith about design principles. Jeremy refers to <cite>Design Squiggle</cite> and the <cite>Double Design Diamond</cite> (which can be seen as two Design Squiggles after each other):

Jeremy maintains a [list of design principles](https://principles.adactio.com). Not all principles on the list are good, but Jeremy likes to collect them.

Useful design principles provoke conflict and make **prioritization statements** like <q>we value X over Y</q> which allows to get into a discussion and make decisions, for example <q>we value usability over profitability.</q>

Another criteria to identify useful design principles is the **reversability test**. The design principle should make sense even if you reverse it, but it would then only make sense for a different organisation, like <q>we value profitability over usability.</q>

Jeremy´s favourite design principle for the web is:

> In case of conflict, consider users over authors over implementors over theoretical purity.
> <footer>Priority of Constituencies Design Principle</footer>

Some design principles come across as a law:

> Be conservative in what you send, and liberal in what you accept.
> <footer>Postel´s law</footer>
  
> In the web frontend stack – HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ARIA – if you can solve a problem with a simpler solution lower in the stack, you should. It´s less fragile, more foolproof, and just works.
> <footer>The principle of least power</footer>

Leveraging the least power principle:

> JavaScript should only do what only JavaScript can do.
> <footer>Jeremy Keith</footer>

The design principle of the web, which favors accessibility over control, is:

> Ubiquity over consistency
> <footer>Design principle of the web</footer>
  
Because of that design principle it´s possible to open a web page from 30 years ago in a modern browser and the web page is usable.
