The heading font used on [THE Eleventy Meetup website](https://11tymeetup.dev) sprang to my eye. The font is named Londrina and it is a beautiful and interesting font for the purpose of headings or accents. Google fonts has a [<cite>Londrina Super Font Family</cite>](https://fonts.google.com/?query=londrina), made by [Marcelo Magalhães](https://tipospereira.com/), and consisting of

- Londrina Sketch,
- Londrina Solid,
- Londrina Outline,
- Londrina Shadow.

On Marcelo´s page are [samples of Londrina](https://tipospereira.com/londrina-typeface).
