IÂ´ve been participating in the private beta of the new [iA Presenter](https://ia.net/presenter) application. I like the app very much, because it improves the preparation phase of a presentation, as well as the presentation itself. [<cite>How much would you charge for iA Presenter?</cite>](https://ia.net/topics/how-much-would-you-charge-for-ia-presenter) is asking for a suitable price. The article contains an analysis of different software pricing models, and pricings of different applications in the market, which is interesting to read.
