Reading Shamsi Brinn´s article [<cite>Why I moved on from Figma</cite>](https://nohandoff.org/why-i-dont-use-figma/) made me nod many times. Shamsi is doing functional prototypes with HTML and Bootstrap instead of creating Figma-based upfront designs. She articulates so many insightful points in a way I couldn´t. Check out her [nohandoff.org](https://nohandoff.org) website, it´s great. My summary (the entire article is well worth reading):

## Figma drawbacks
- Project handoff is baked into Figma, because it is used to create an intermediate product.
- Figma doesn´t directly contribute to rapidly iterating, testing, and improving. It is more aligned with waterfall.
- Engineers are left holding the accessibility hot potato because of handoff.
- The visual design that comes out of Figma encourages polished work, that might gain buy-in too quickly and kills discovery.
## Functional prototype benefits
- A functional prototype speaks everyone´s language. We all understand web functions presented in a browser.
- Working on a functional prototype mitigates handoff because the prototype makes the transition to the product much easier.
- No design can think of everything upfront. Edge cases, responsiveness and accessibility can be tested in their native habitat.
- Design and technical goals can be measured at the same cadence, building team cohesion.
- The one constant we can rely on is that projects change and morph, which is what agile strives to embody for engineers. Functional prototyping embraces that reality for designers, too.
