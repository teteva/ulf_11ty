I´m following Jonnie on his blog [<cite>destroytoday.com</cite>](https://destroytoday.com) for some time now. In this video Jonnie talks about how his father makes things and how Jonnie has been influenced by his father. It´s a beautiful example of making things <em>and</em> documenting the process. I think there is a parralel to how Jonnie is working on his [Cushion](https://cushionapp.com) app and how he is [documenting](https://cushionapp.com/blog) his work and his decisions.
