> I like the new hype: [YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it) is popular again.
>
> Projects like Vue, HTMX and unpoly, alpine.js or just vanilla are getting traction.
>
> There is talk of coming back to using Postgres for most things.
>
> 37signals is on the spotlight once more, because they left the cloud.
>
> It will, of course, be overdone. Because minimalism being hyped is still... hype.
>
> You do need the cloud, containers, nosql, go, rust and js build systems. Modern software requirements, customersâ€™ expectations and incredible new features are not to be ignored.
>
> Just not for everything.
>
> Nothing is ever needed for everything.
