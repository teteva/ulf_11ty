Hidde de Vries describes his *[Eleventy starter project for Web Content Accessibility (WCAG) reports](https://hiddedevries.nl/en/blog/2021-05-24-introducing-an-eleventy-starter-project-for-wcag-reports)*, which is published on GitHub as [eleventy-wcag-reporter](https://github.com/hidde/eleventy-wcag-reporter). 
The basic idea is to take manually created findings, file them one-by-one as markdown with frontmatter data, and turn use Eleventy to turn them alltogether into a report of findings. It is *not* automatically identifying issues. According to Hidde: *"It is issue oriented, promotes rich text, comes with a PDF export script and supports two languages (English and Dutch)."*
