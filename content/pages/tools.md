I build and share these tools. Some are just tiny npm packages, some are complete applications. You may want to have a quick look at:

[<cite>Letter for iA Writer</cite>](/tools/ia-letter/)
: An iA Writer template to create letters with correctly positioned address fields.

[<cite>Breakdown for Atom</cite>](/tools/breakdown/)
: A package to be added to your Atom editor. It allows you to display and manipulate a breakdown structure of your Jira Scrum project.

[<cite>Spitfire</cite>](/tools/spitfire/)
: A virtual whiteboard to be shared by multiple people at the same time.

[<cite>sotable</cite>](/tools/sotable/)
: Make any HTML table sortable.

[<cite>active-toc</cite>](/tools/active-toc/)
: Highlight the entries of your table of contents while scrolling.

[<cite>cumulative-flow</cite>](/tools/cumulative-flow/)
: A npm package to draw a SVG cumulative flow diagram and predict the anticipated completion of work.

[<cite>somap</cite>](/tools/somap/)
: A npm package with a sorted map and sorted set, implemented as a binary tree.
