I try to make this site accessible by following my [here documented approach](/2020-08-21-my-approach-to-accessibility/). I plan to have an *accessibility statement*^[[As an excellent example, look at the accessibility statement of Ethan Marcotte´s site](https://ethanmarcotte.com/accessibility/)] at this place. For now, it´s only a list of keys that help to navigate the site with the keyboard.

{% include "keyboard.html" %}
