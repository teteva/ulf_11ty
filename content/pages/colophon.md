This site does not use Cookies. I´m proud it has a service worker on board – so it´s a *Progressive Web App.* It is built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) on a Mac, stored on [Github](https://github.com) and served by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). The server-side fulltext search is powered by a Netlify [*edge function*](/2023-01-07-edge-search/), leveraging [MiniSearch](https://lucaong.github.io/minisearch/). The typeface is [iA Writer Quattro](https://ia.net/topics/a-typographic-christmas). The font size will adjust to your window size and has been calculated with the [Fluid Type Scale Calculator](https://www.fluid-type-scale.com). I used to write [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) with [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) and all code with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). Recently I started to write all markdown and all code with the superfast [Zed](https://zed.dev) editor. The CSS toolkit is [Tailwind CSS](/2023-01-24-my-first-attempt-with-tailwind-css/). [Prism](https://prismjs.com) is used for syntax highlighting of code blocks.
