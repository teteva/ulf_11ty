I´m proud it has a service worker on board – so it´s a *Progressive Web App.* The typeface is [iA Writer Quattro](https://ia.net/topics/a-typographic-christmas). I write [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) with [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) and all code with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). The CSS toolkit is [Compose](/tools/compose/) and the client-side search is powered by [Lunr](https://lunrjs.com/).
