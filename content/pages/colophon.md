This site does not use Cookies. It is built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) on a Mac, stored on [Github](https://github.com) and served by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). I´m proud it has a service worker on board – so it´s a *Progressive Web App.* The typeface is [iA Writer Quattro](https://ia.net/topics/a-typographic-christmas) for body text and [IBM Plex Sans](https://www.ibm.com/plex/) for headings and display text. I write [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) with [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) and all code with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). The CSS toolkit is [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). [Prism](https://prismjs.com) and the okaidia theme is used for syntax highlighting of code blocks. The client-side search is powered by [Lunr](https://lunrjs.com/).
