<p>My name is Ulf Schneider and this is my website. I´m a software developer and agile coach, currently heading the Processes & Quality team of Diebold Nixdorf Professional Services. If you like, here is a bit more about my <a href="/about">professional career</a>. </p>
<p>At this place I´m publishing my thoughts about <a href="/blog/agile/">agile</a> software development. I´m also building and sharing a set of <a href="/blog/tools/">tools</a> which help me to shape my workspace a <em>little</em> more to my liking.</p>
<p>One of my most recent projects is a <a href="/blog/strael/">Fairlight Strael</a> build. Every now and then my son Emil makes a drawing, which I aim to <a href="/images/emil-drawing/">capture</a> here. Emil created a picture of <a href="/2020-03-18-emil-pictured-the-coronavirus/">the virus</a> at beginning of the Corona pandemic.</p>
